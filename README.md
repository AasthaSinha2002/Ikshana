Ikshana, An idea, an application.
A collective effort our team,to contribute something to help better the lives of the specially challenged. Ikshana will be an application that becomes a direct help towards the blind community helping out not only the Blind but also the people working with them.
Ikshana is an OBR optical braille reader which will help out in cutting down the time taken to read a braille script to a fraction of what it used to be,using your smartphone camera and in future it will be directly installed into spectacles.The application will have a speech and text output converting any braille text to an understandable format.
This will be our little contribution towards the betterment of our society and to improve the lives of the specially challenged even by a little.
